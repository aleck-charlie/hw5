For this work scheduler project, I created time-block rows using JQuery and a for-loop to append them to the HTML.

I added in todays day using moment.js, and used if statements to color current, past and present hour.

Moving forward I want to be able to show saved tasks from localStorage and have "saved!" message appear when save button is clicked
