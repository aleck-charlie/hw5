For this work scheduler project, I created time-block rows using JQuery and a for-loop to append them to the HTML.

I added in todays day using moment.js, and used if statements to color current, past and present hour.

Moving forward I want to be able to pull from saved storage to display saved tasks using localStorage.getItem, and debug my savedMessage function so it shows a message when saved button is clicked.
